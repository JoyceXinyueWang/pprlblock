# pprlblock

Python routines for private indexing/blocking for PPRL (Privacy Preserving Record Linkage)

### Six private blocking/indexing methods:
1. Three-party k-nearest neighbour based clustering (Kar12 kNN)
  * Reference table based k-anonymous private blocking

2. Three-party Sorted neighbourhood clustering - SIM based merging (Vat13PAKDD - SNC3PSim)
  *  Blocks are generated by sorting reference values, and inserting the
     values from the databases into an inverted index where reference values
     are the keys. Blocks are then formed that each contain at least k
     records.
   
3. Three-party Bloom filter Locality Sensitive hashing based blocking (Dur12 - HLSH)

4. Two-party Sorted neighbourhood clustering (Vat13CIKM - SNC2P)
  *  Blocks are generated by sorting random reference values, and inserting the
     values from the databases into an inverted index where reference values
     are the keys. Blocks are then formed such that each contains at least k
     records. Database owners exchange the reference values at least one from
     each cluster which are sorted over which a slab of width w is moved to
     find the clusters of Alice and Bob to be merged to generate candidate
     record pairs.

5. Two-party hclustering based blocking (Kuz13 - HCLUST)
